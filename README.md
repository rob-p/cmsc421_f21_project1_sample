# cmsc421_f21_project1_sample

Some sample input/output for project 1

The output in `test_output` was created by running : `./randsim 100 5 0.2 test_input/sars_cov2.fa sample_reads`
where `randsim` is the name of the simulator you create in part (a).  Note, `randsim` is not provided in this 
repository for obvious reasons.  Further, while your statistics should be similar, the `var_depth` and
`num_islands` values may be somewhat different given that each simulation is _random_.
